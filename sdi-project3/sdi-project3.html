<p>Day: 27 - We've been under lockdown since that day. They were kind enough to allow us to keep one personal item as to keep our sanity, more likely to keep moral high and not have us do something stupid. I fear all hope is gone and this will be our final resting place. John is the leader of the others and with several attempts to have a sit down with him he has finally agreed to meet with me. I need to negotiate the release of our group. I'm not sure what I can do, we have nothing to offer and he has no reason to release people he considers dangerous right outside his front doorstep. I have to do something though. </p>

<p>The meeting begins as any meeting in a normal world would have. We exchange pleasantries and act like old friends who haven't seen each other in months, he makes me sick. "I want my people released, thats the only thing I want. Keep our supplies, keep our valuables, leave us our guns and send us on our way." He looks at me with a twisted smirk. I know this punk is thinking something that I don't want to hear but I have to ask him, "What?" I yell. He proceeds to tell me he'll release our guns and let us go free but he wants Sara to stay behind with them. I refuse, I know what he is planning and I wont let that happen. "Keep me instead" I say, "I wont be useful to you the way you want but I can do hard work and I don't mind taking orders. Besides your base could use extra security." Reluctantly he agrees and makes the arrangements for the group to be released this evening. </p>

<p>8:30 rolls around and it's almost time to say goodbye. Not enjoying this but it has to be done, sacrifice for the greater good. I only hope one day they'll come find me and we can be a group again, I've grown too attached it seems. As the clock ticks by for what seems to be an eternity they finally get their weapons, no ammo until they reach the outside though. As John begins opening the door for what will likely be our final moments together loud moans begin echoing throughout the compound, they must have followed one of the others on their daily supply run. Several zombies bust through the door knocking John to the floor as my group backs up and begins to assess the situation. JD sneaks off towards a back room as the compound begins to get over run. The others are struggling to keep order as one by one they fall. John who is infected but not turned is now forcing his way through my group to me, as he stands in front of me I'm looking at him down the barrel of his gun. "That it, it's time" I realize. </p>

<p>I hear the bang of the gun and flinch. It's pathetic what my last face is, except it's not. I see JD standing across the room pointing a gun in our general direction when I notice John is on the ground. JD running full speed throws a bag of ammo and weapons to Jeff who starts handing out automatic weapons as JD takes off toward the incoming horde. He stops, lines up his shot and starts firing as everyone in our group begins charging up the battlefield to help. The gunfire is so loud and fast it shakes me to my core. My eyes water from the burning smell of gunpowder and I turn to rub my eyes. It goes silent, I turn back to see nothing moving. It's over, all of Johns men are dead and my group survives alone. I look at JD and he confirms it, "We should gather everything we can and move to the next town." As we turn to slide the door to the compound closed he says with assurance "The next town will be better." It's on the road again. </p>
